# CS309-SystemOrg
Introduction to low level hardware and assembly (ARM on the Rasberry Pi).

Labs 1-3 were just building circuits, and I don't know if that's github material.

Lab 4 and 5 were basic Assembly stuff. Code is poorly written, but it works.

Lab 4: List factorials from 1 to a user specified number (only accepts values from 1 to 12).
Lab 5: A Gas Station interface (?), logic is horribly b/c I only knew a couple opcodes. Much of it is duplicates with slight deviation.
